# UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
## Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
  - Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
## Key Conventions
  - Use 'nuqs' for URL search parameter state management.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
  - Limit 'use client':
    - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
    - Use only for Web API access in small components.
    - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
  
## Follow Next.js docs for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

## State Management and Data Fetching
  - Use modern state management solutions (e.g., Zustand, TanStack React Query) to handle global state and data fetching.
  - Implement validation using Zod for schema validation.
    
## Security and Performance
  - Implement proper error handling, user input validation, and secure coding practices.
  - Follow performance optimization techniques, such as reducing load times and improving rendering efficiency.
